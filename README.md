My name is Santi, I develop apps in C# and games in Unity, but I'm currently trying to learn some other languages and new technologies to expand my knowledge. 

You can find here some projects that I've developed. These can be:

- Utilities or apps that I needed ðŸ§°
- Things I developed for fun ðŸŽ‰
- Things I developed to learn ðŸ“š
